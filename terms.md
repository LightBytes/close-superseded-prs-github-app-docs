# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Close Superseded PRs
GitHub App (the "Service"). By installing or using the Service, you agree to
these Terms.

## 1. Service provided "as is"

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not make
any warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee that
the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.

## 2. Free tier limitations

The free tier is offered to help teams automate routine workflows. We may
modify, suspend, or discontinue the free tier at any time, with or without
notice. We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from such
changes.

## 3. Use of the Service

You are responsible for how you configure and use the Service, including
ensuring it has the appropriate permissions for your repositories. You agree
not to misuse the Service or attempt to disrupt its operation.

## 4. Third-party services

The Service integrates with third-party platforms (including GitHub). Your use
of those platforms is governed by their terms and policies. We are not
responsible for third-party availability or changes.

## 5. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after
changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, contact us via the support channel
listed on the app's marketplace listing or documentation site.
