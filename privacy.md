# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the Close Superseded PRs GitHub App (the
"Service") handles data.

## 1. Data we process

The Service receives GitHub webhook payloads for pull request events, reads
repository content (such as PR bodies and optional config files), and writes
comments or labels as configured.

## 2. Data we store

We store only installation configuration data required to run the Service (for
example, default labels, keywords, and template settings). We do not store PR
content beyond the time needed to process a webhook request.

## 3. Data retention

Configuration data is retained until you uninstall the app or delete the
configuration. Operational logs may be retained for a limited period for
security and debugging.

## 4. Data sharing

We do not sell or share your data with third parties. The Service uses GitHub's
APIs to perform actions in your repositories.

## 5. Your control

You can change or delete configuration settings at any time, or uninstall the
app to stop all processing.

## 6. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the
Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us via the support
channel listed on the app's marketplace listing or documentation site.
